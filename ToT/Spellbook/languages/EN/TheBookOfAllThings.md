# The Book of All Things

## Teaching the Book of All Things
- Dear students, this is the book of all things. You are allowed to write down new additions and spells. 
- Neat! but... I cannot write anything, there is no free pages.
- Oh, yes, we know. Let me look for some place, some.. here! you have this margin, you can write whatever you want there. 
- Is a margin, is not big enough. Can you add more pages? 
- What?? No! This book is untochable! We have a newer, bigger and unused book thou. 
- Fantastic! 
- Is not used so is useless, use the margin. 

## I don't know why it works
- Teacher! I don't know what is happening with my spell. 
- Oh! it is working, isn't it nice? 
- Well, I don't know how I did it? 
- You don't what? 
- I don't know how I did it! It should not work! I just erased half of the page and it is still working!
- ASSISTANT! BRING THE HOLY WATER!

## There was a problem
- Why this silver solvent is not working with my copper solution? I will look for more info in other researchers notes. Probably someone else fixed already.

Nevermid, I fixed it.

## Use the golems
- Are you wizards? 
- Yes
- Yup, we are

- Cool
- Nice
- I have a question. What do you think about managing the Knight selection using golems to retrieve the votes?
- ARE YOU CRAZY
- NO WAY
