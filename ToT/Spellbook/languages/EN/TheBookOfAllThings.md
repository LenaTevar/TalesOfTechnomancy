## Teaching the Book of All Things
- Dear students, this is the book of all things. You are allowed to write down new additions and spells. 
- Neat! but... I cannot write anything, there is no free pages.
- Oh, yes, we know. Let me look for some place, some.. here! you have this margin, you can write whatever you want there. 
- Is a margin, is not big enough. Can you add more pages? 
- What?? No! This book is untochable! We have a newer, bigger and unused book thou. 
- Fantastic! 
- Is not used so is useless, use the margin.
