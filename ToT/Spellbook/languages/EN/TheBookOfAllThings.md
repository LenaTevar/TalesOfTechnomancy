# The Book of All Things

## Teaching the Book of All Things
- Dear students, this is the book of all things. You are allowed to write down new additions and spells. 
   - Neat! but... I cannot write anything, there is no free pages.
- Oh, yes, we know. Let me look for some place, some.. here! you have this margin, you can write whatever you want there. 
   - Is a margin, is not big enough. Can you add more pages? 
- What?? No! This book is untochable! We have a newer, bigger and unused book thou. 
   - Fantastic! 
- Is not used so is useless, use the margin. 

## I don't know why it works
- Teacher! I don't know what is happening with my spell. 
   - Oh! it is working, isn't it nice? 
- Well, I don't know how I did it? 
   - You don't what? 
- I don't know how I did it! It should not work! I just erased half of the page and it is still working!
   - ASSISTANT! BRING THE HOLY WATER!

## There was a problem
- Why this silver solvent is not working with my copper solution? I will look for more info in other researchers notes. Probably someone else fixed already.
 
```
Day 233,
The silver solvent is not working with the copper solution even when I boiled the lizard eyes for three days. 
..
..
Day 234, 
Nevermid, I fixed it.

## Use the golems
- Are you wizards? 
   - Yes
   - Yup, we are
- Oh! I'm a great fan of Magic!! Look, I have a golem pet, and my clock is magically connected with my brain
   - Cool
   - Nice
- I have a question. What do you think about managing the Knight selection using golems to retrieve the votes?
   - ARE YOU CRAZY
   - NO WAY
   - THAT IS THE MOST STUPID IDEA I EVER HEARD

## Have you tried it? 
- I made this awesome potion that will make our pets to talk!
   - Nice, did you test it?
-  I was to busy making it but I'm confident that...  *drops potion to dog. Dog explotes* ... it worked on my papers. 

## It is not a mistake!!
- I made a golem
   - Your golem wants to jump into the chimeney 
- He is ambitious!
   - He is broken
- No, is not! It's a perk!
